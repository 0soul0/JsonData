trace;Their outward needs are those of other men.And theirs the forms of earthly life,Theirs sleeping, waking, want, and strife,Yet this they have that they despiseWhat fairest seems to earthly eyes.3And inwardly their life is from above,The Lord\u2019s Almighty Word hath quickened them;Flames kindled from the everlasting Love,The children of the New Jerusalem;Their brethren are the saints in light,And songs of sweetness infiniteThey sing with them to God Most High,A deep and wondrous melody.4They walk upon the earth, and dwell in heaven,Though pow\u2019rless, guard the world with arms unseen;Deep peace to them in midst of strife is given,And all they wish they have, though poor and mean.Storms beat them, but may not destroy,Fast rooted in eternal joy;They walk as in the shade of death,Yet living on in silent faith.5When Christ their Life shall be made manifest,When He shall come with all His pow\u2019r to rule,Their glory, hidden long, shall be confessed;Arise and shine!

me there;Well pleased a prisoner to be,Because, my God, it pleaseth Thee.2Nought have I else to do,I sing the whole day long;And He whom most I love to pleaseDoth listen to my song;He caught and bound my wandering wing;But still He bends to hear me sing.3Thou hast an ear to hearA heart to love and bless;And though my notes were e\u2019er so rude,Thou wouldst not hear the less;Because Thou knowest as they fall,That love, sweet love, inspires them all.4My cage confines me round;Abroad I cannot fly;But though my wing is closely bound,My heart\u2019s at liberty;For prison walls cannot controlThe flight, the freedom of the soul.5O it is good to soarThese bolts and bars above!To Him whose purpose I adore,Whose providence I love;And in Thy mighty will to findThe joy, the freedom of the mind.",

Friend we have in Jesus,All our sins and griefs to bear!What a privilege to carryEverything to God in prayer!O what peace we often forfeit,O what needless pain we bear,All because we do not carryEverything to God in prayer!2Have we trials and temptations?Is there trouble anywhere?We should never be discouraged,Take it to the Lord in prayer.Can we find a friend so faithfulWho will all our sorrows share?Jesus knows our every weakness,Take it to the Lord in prayer.3Are we weak and heavy-laden,Cumbered with a load of care?Precious Savior, still our refugeTake it to the Lord in prayer;Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?Take it to the Lord in prayer;In His arms He\u2019ll take and shield thee,Thou wilt find a solace there.", "refrain": "", "author": "Joseph Scriven", "category":

not how or when.But this I know, that He was born of Mary,When Bethl\u2019hem\u2019s manger was His only home,And that He lived at Nazareth and labored,And so the Savior, Savior of the world, is come.2I cannot tell how silently He suffered,As with His peace He graced this place of tears,Or how His heart upon the Cross was broken,The crown of pain to three and thirty years.But this I know, He heals the broken-hearted,And stays our sin, and calms our lurking fear,And lifts the burden from the heavy laden,For yet the Savior, Savior of the world, is here.3I cannot tell how He will win the nations,How He will claim His earthly heritage,How satisfy the needs and aspirationsOf east and west, of sinner and of sage.But this I know, all flesh shall see His glory,And He shall reap the harvest He has sown,And some glad day His sun shall shine in splendorWhen He the Savior, Savior of the world, is known.4I cannot tell how all the lands shall worship,When, at His bidding, every storm is stilled,Or who can say how great the jubilationWhen all the hearts of men with love are filled.But this I know, the skies will thrill with rapture,And myriad, myriad human voices sing,And earth to heaven, and heaven to earth, will answer:At last the Savior, Savior of the world, is King.", "refrain": "", "author": "", "category": "", "subCategory": "", "url":

the ransomed ever knewHow deep were the waters crossed;Nor how dark was the night which the Lord passed throughEre He found His sheep that was lost.Out in the bleak desert He heard its cryAll bleeding and helpless, and ready to die.4\u201cLord, whence are those blood-drops all the wayThat mark out the mountain\u2019s track?\u201d\u201cThey were shed for one who had gone astrayEre the Shepherd could bring him back.\u201d\u201cLord, whence are Thy hands so rent and torn?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re pierced tonight by many a thorn.\u201d5And all through the mountains, thunder-riven,And up from the rocky steep,There arose a cry to the gate of heaven,\u201cRejoice! I have found My sheep!\u201dAnd the angels echoed around the throne,\u201cRejoice, for the Lord brings back His own!\u201d", "refrain": "", "author": "", "category": "", "subCategory": "", "url":

Lord, I now implore Thee,Mingle now Thy Spirit, Lord, with mine.2Shining Onehow clear the sky above me!Son of Man, I see Thee on the throne!Holy One, the flames of God consume me,Till my being glows with Thee alone.Lord, when first I saw Thee in Thy splendor,All self-love and glory sank in shame;Now my heart its love and praises render,Tasting all the sweetness of Thy name.3Precious Lord, my flask of alabasterGladly now I break in love for Thee;I anoint Thy head, Beloved Master;Lord, behold, I\u2019ve saved the best for Thee.Dearest Lord, I waste myself upon Thee;Loving Thee, I\u2019m deeply satisfied.Love outpoured from hidden depths within me,Costly oil, dear Lord, I would provide.4My Beloved, come on spices\u2019 mountain;How I yearn to see Thee face to face.Drink, dear Lord, from my heart\u2019s flowing fountain,Till I rest fore\u2019er in Thine embrace.Not alone, O Lord, do I adore Thee,But with all the saints as Thy dear Bride;Quickly come, our love is waiting for Thee;Jesus Lord, Thou wilt be satisfied.", "refrain": "", "author": "", "category": "", "subCategory": "", "url": "https://www.hymnal.net/en/hymn/h/1159", "pianoSpectrum":

center to circumferenceGod would saturate each part;Feeling, mind, and will renewing,Making home in all our heart.5Thus in life we\u2019re built together,Then in love we\u2019re knit as one;God is now His plan fulfilling,Finishing what He\u2019s begun.Lord, increase Thyself within usThat we might be built by TheeInto that great corporate vesselFilled with God exclusively.6As the product, the fulfillment,Will the church in glory stand,Consummation of the purposeIn eternal ages planned.God will have His corporate vessel,All His glory to contain;Lord, we\u2019re wholly for Thy purposeAll Thy

Oh, how precious!", "content": "1Oh, how glorious! Oh, how precious!Now the Spirit dwells in me.Life imparting, truth revealing,Shining, leading constantly.2Word of promise, real within me,Life divine now freeing meFrom sin\u2019s cruel control releasing,From death\u2019s power setting free.3Deepest springs of life dispensing,Like the hart I thirst for Thee;Desp\u2019rate, may I drink Thy fullness,\u2019Till Thy river flows through me.4May my self be put to death, Lord,Under Thy control I\u2019d be,Transformed to Thy living image,I\u2019d forever flow out Thee.", "refrain": "Fill me now!
