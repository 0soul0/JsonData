It tells me that He is my Savior From sin and sickness and the grave. I love the precious name of Jesus, For I am one He came to save!3 Though dear to us the name of Jesus, The name of Christ is higher still! It tells of Him who dwells within us, Our old heart to renew and fill. It tells me of the Spirit\u2019s fullness, It brings the pow\u2019r of Pentecost. O blessed Christ, anoint me also, And fill me with the Holy Ghost!",

Lord of battles, God of armies, He has gained the victory; He who on the cross did suffer, He who from the grave arose, He has vanquished sin and Satan, He by death, He by death, He bydeath has spoiled His foes.3 While He lifts His hands in blessing He is parted from His friends; While their eager eyes behold Him, He upon the clouds ascends; He who walked with God and pleased Him, Preaching truth and doom to come, He, our Enoch, is translated To His home, to His home, to Hiseverlasting home.4 Now our heavenly Aaron enters, With His blood, within the veil; Joshua now is come to Canaan, And the kings before Him quail; Now He plants the tribes of Israel In their promised resting-place; Now our great Elijah offers Of His grace, of His grace,double portion of His grace.5 He has raised our human nature On the clouds to God\u2019s right hand; There we sit in heav\u2019nly places, There with Him in glory stand. Jesus reigns, adored by angels; Man with God is on the throne; Mighty Lord, in Thine ascension We by faith, we by faith, we byfaith behold our own.",

What love with Thine can vie?4 Though in the very form of God, With heav\u2019nly glory crowned, Thou didst a servant\u2019s form assume, Beset with sorrow round.5 Thou wouldst like wretched man be made In everything but sin, That we as like Thee might become As we unlike had been:6 Like Thee in strength, in meekness, love, In life in ev\u2019ry phase; From glory into glory changed, Till we behold Thy face.7 O Lord, we treasure in our hearts The mem\u2019ry of Thy love; And ever shall Thy name to us A grateful odor prove.",

Worlds and men and angels All consist in Thee, Yet Thou camest to us In humility.4 Jesus! all perfections Rise and end in Thee; Brightness of God\u2019s glory Thou, eternally. Favored beyond measure They Thy face who see; May we, gracious Savior, Share this ecstasy.",

Oh, there Thy grace unbounded And perfect love we see; With joy and sorrow mingling, We would remember Thee.4 We know Thee now as risen, The Firstborn from the dead; We see Thee now ascended, The Church\u2019s glorious Head. In Thee by grace accepted, The heart and mind set free To think of all Thy sorrow, And thus remember Thee.5 Till Thou shalt come in glory, And call us hence away, To rest in all the brightness Of that unclouded day, We show Thy death, Lord Jesus, And here would seek to be More to Thy death conformed, While we remember Thee.",

Let that grace, Lord, like a fetter, Bind my wand\u2019ring heart to Thee. Teach me, Lord, some rapturous measure, Meet for me Thy grace to prove, While I sing the countless treasure Of my God\u2019s unchanging love.3 Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it; Prone to leave the God I love: Take my heart, oh, take and seal it With Thy Spirit from above. Rescued thus from sin and danger, Purchased by the Savior\u2019s blood, May I walk on earth a stranger, As a son and heir of God.",

By the brightness of Thy face, Ever let me grow in grace.5 Let me, then, be always growing, Never, never standing still, Listening, learning, better knowing Thee and Thy most blessed will.

Till the vessel\u2019s emptied Broken at His feet; Waiting till His filling Makes the work complete.3 Utterly abandoned To the will of God; Walking in the pathway That my Master trod; Leaving ease and pleasure; Making Him my choice, Waiting for His guidance, Listening for His voice.4 Utterly abandoned! Through eternity; My will never choosing, His it e\u2019er shall be; All my plans and longings Lost in His sweet will, Having nothing, owning All things in Him still.5 Utterly abandoned!\u2019 Tis so sweet to be Captive in His love-bonds, Yet so wondrous free; Free from sin\u2019s dominion, Free from doubt and fear, Free from every worry, Burden, grief or care.6 Utterly abandoned! Oh, the rest is sweet, Waiting in His presence At His blessed feet; Waiting for the filling Of the Host divine, Who my inward parts shall Perfectly refine.7 Lo!

O \u2019tis not in grief to harm me, While Thy love is left to me; O \u2019twere not in joy to charm me, Were that joy unmixed with Thee.4 Haste then on from grace to glory, Armed by faith and winged by prayer; God\u2019s eternal day\u2019s before thee, God\u2019s own hand shall guide thee there. Soon shall close thy earthly mission, Swift shall pass thy pilgrim days, Hope shall change to glad fruition, Faith to sight, and prayer to praise.",

I should, were He always thus nigh, Have nothing to wish or to fear; No mortal so happy as I; My summer would last all the year.3 Content with beholding His face, My all to His pleasure resigned; No changes of season or place, Would make any change in my mind. While blessed with a sense of His love, A palace a toy would appear; And prisons would palaces prove, If Jesus would dwell with me there.4 My Lord, if indeed I am Thine, If Thou art my sun and my song, Say, why do I languish and pine? And why are my winters so long? Oh, drive these dark clouds from the sky, Thy soul-cheering presence restore; Or take me to Thee up on high, Where winter and clouds are no more.",

And my drooping soul He cheers; Do you think He ne\u2019er reproves me?

Thou diedst for me, I hear Thy whisper in my heart; The morning breaks, the shadows flee: Pure, universal Love Thou art; To me, to all Thy mercies move; Thy nature and Thy name is Love.6 Lame as I am, I take the prey; Hell, earth and sin, with ease o\u2019ercome.

God\u2019s own hand the vessel filling From the glory far above, Longing hearts forever stilling With the riches of His love.3 Thus though worn, and tried, and tempted, Glorious calling, saint, is thine; Let the Lord but find thee emptied, Living branch in Christ the Vine! Vessels of the world\u2019s despising, Vessels weak and poor and base, Bearing wealth God\u2019s heart is prizing, Glory from Christ\u2019s blessed face.4 Oh to be but emptier, lowlier, Mean, unnoticedand unknown, And to God a vessel holier, Filled with Christ and Christ alone! Naught of earth to cloud the glory, Naught of self the light to dim, Telling forth His wondrous story, Emptied to be filled with Him.",

And theirs the forms of earthly life, Theirs sleeping, waking, want, and strife, Yet this they have that they despise What fairest seems to earthly eyes.3 And inwardly their life is from above, The Lord\u2019s Almighty Word hath quickened them; Flames kindled from the everlasting Love, The children of the New Jerusalem; Their brethren are the saints in light, And songs of sweetness infinite They sing with them to God Most High, A deep and wondrous melody.4 They walk upon the earth, and dwell in heaven, Though pow\u2019rless, guard the world with arms unseen; Deep peace to them in midst of strife is given, And all they wish they have, though poor and mean. Storms beat them, but may not destroy, Fast rooted in eternal joy; They walk as in the shade of death, Yet living on in silent faith.5 When Christ their Life shall be made manifest, When He shall come with all His pow\u2019r to rule, Their glory, hidden long, shall be confessed; Arise and shine! O bright and beautiful! With Christ ye shall ascend on high, Victorious in His victory The hidden light shall shine afar, Each saint an everlasting star.",

There\u2019s nothing here deserves my joys, There\u2019s nothing like my God, There\u2019s nothing like my God.3 To Thee I owe my wealth, and friends, And health, and safe abode; Thanks to Thy name for meaner things, But they are not my God, But they are not my God.4 How vain a toy is glittering wealth, If once compared to Thee! Or what\u2019s my safety, or my health, Or all my friends to me, Or all my friends to me.5 Were I possessor of the earth, And called the stars my own, Without Thy graces and Thyself, I were a wretch undone, I were a wretch undone.6 Let others stretch their arms like seas, And grasp in all the shore; Grant me the visits of Thy grace, And I desire no more, And I desire no more.",

How little hast thou gone!

Oh, refuge tried and sweet! Oh, trysting place where heaven\u2019s love And heaven\u2019s justice meet. As to the holy patriarch That wondrous dream was given, So is my Savior by the cross A ladder up to heaven.3 There lies beneath its shadow, But on the farther side, The darkness of an awful grave That gapes both deep and wide; And there between us stands the cross, Two arms outstretched to save, Like a watchman set to guard the way From that eternal grave.4 Upon that cross of Jesus Mine eye at times can see The very dying form of One, Who suffered there for me; And from my smitten heart, with tears, Two wonders I confess, The wonders of His glorious love, And my own worthlessness.5 I take, O cross, thy shadow For my abiding place; I ask no other sunshine than The sunshine of His face; Content to let the world go by, To know no gain nor loss, My sinful self my only shame, My glory all the cross.",

The gardens many would be faint, Unwet by showers from weeping eyes! The gold by fire is purified; The saint is by much trouble tried.3 The heavier the cross, the stronger faith: The loaded palm strikes deeper root; The vine juice sweetly issueth When men have pressed the clustered fruit; And courage grows where dangers come, Like pearls beneath the salty foam.4 The heavier the cross, the deeper prayer; The bruised herbs most fragrant are. If sky and wind were always fair, The sailor would not watch the star; And David\u2019s Psalms had ne\u2019er been sung If grief his heart had never wrung.5 The heavier the cross, the more inspired; From vales to climb to mountain crest; The pilgrim, of the desert tired, Longs for the Canaan of his rest. The dove has here no rest in sight, And to the ark she wings her flight.6 The heavier the cross, the easier to die; Death is a kinder face to see; Our life\u2019s decay we dare defy, From life\u2019s distress we then are free. The cross sublimely lifts our faith To Him who triumphed over death.7 Thou Crucified! the cross I bear. The longer, may it dearer be; And lest I faint while ling\u2019ring here, Implant Thou such a heart in me That faith and love may flourish e\u2019er Till for the cross the crown I wear.",

Yet we fail not, for God\u2019s angels Minister to us, and say,\u201c Look, beloved, at the glory, Conflict is but for a day!\u201d5 Then the Cross! for via Calvary Every royal soul must go; Here we draw the veil, for Jesus Only can the pathway show;\u201c If we suffer with Him,\u201d listen, Just a little, little while, And the memory will have faded In the glory of His smile!6 Then the grave, with dear ones weeping, Knowing that all life has fled;( Fellow-pilgrims, art thou numbered With the men the world calls dead?) Thence we rise, and live with Jesus, Throned above the world\u2019s mad strife, Gladly forfeiting forever, All that worldlings count as life.7 On we press! and yonder gleaming, Nearing every day, we see The great walls of that fair city, God has built for such as we; And we catch the tender music Of the choirs that sing of One Who once died to have us with Him In His kingdom, on the throne.8 Just a few more miles, beloved! And our feet shall ache no more; No more sin, and no more sorrow, Hush thee, Jesus went before; And I hear Him sweetly whispering,\u201c Faint not, fear not, still press on, For it may be ere tomorrow, The long journey will be done.\u201d",

What thou never could\u2019st accomplish Shall His Spirit work through thee, While thy soul this witness beareth,\u2019 Tis not I, but Christ in me.3 In Him dwelleth all God\u2019s fulness, In Him thou art made complete; Rise, and claim thy heavenly birthright, Kneeling at thy Father\u2019s feet. He will never disappoint thee, Praise Him that the gift is thine; Then go forth to live each moment On sufficiency divine.4 Lord, I come, and simply resting On Thy faithful, changeless word, I believe the blood doth cleanse me, And that Christ is crowned Lord. Grant henceforth a ceaseless outflow Of Thy life and love through me; Reaching those who sit in darkness, Winning priceless souls to Thee.",

Thy foes will rejoice when my sorrows they see, And smile at the tears I have shed.4 Ye daughters of Zion, declare, have you seen The Star that on Israel shone?

He told me no less; The heirs of salvation, I know from His Word, Through much tribulation Must follow their Lord.5 How bitter that cup No heart can conceive, Which He drank quite up, That sinners might live! His way was much rougher And darker than mine; Did Christ, my Lord, suffer, And shall I repine?6 Since all that I meet Shall work for my good, The bitter is sweet, The medicine, food; Though painful at present,\u2019 Twill cease before long, And then, oh, how pleasant The conqueror\u2019s song!",

To take the cross and follow Thee, Where love and duty lead, shall be My portion and my praise.",

As in the days of Galilee, Disease still flees at His command; But ere His touch your frame can feel, You, too, must still stretch forth your hand.3 What though you feel so weak and faint? He can your will with strength endue, New faith and courage breathe within And work in you to will and do. Reach out to meet His quickening touch; Take up your bed, arise and stand; And pressing through to meet your Lord, Stretch forth your hand, stretch forth your hand.",

Stir, till I learn to pray exceedingly; Stir, till I learn to wait expectantly.4 Stir me, oh, stir me, Lord, Thy heart was stirred By love\u2019s intensest fire, till Thou didst give Thine only Son, Thy best beloved One, E\u2019en to the dreadful cross, that I might live. Stir me to give myself so back to Thee, That Thou canst give Thyself again through me.5 Stir me, oh, stir me, Lord, for I can see Thy glorious triumph-day begin to break; The dawn already gilds the eastern sky; Oh, Church of Christ, arise, awake, awake. Oh! stir us, Lord, as heralds of that day. For night is past, our King is on His way.",

Earth-vision blurred and dim, their eyes doth hold But broken gleams have they of radiance gold; Too dazzling is the splendor of the whole.2 Brothers with brothers have not all one heart, In wrath they turn away and walk apart, Who from one stream of life had common birth. What fight for forms! O\u2019er doctrines what vain strife! Instead together sharing God\u2019s one life, Who worshipped is by heaven and by earth.3\u201c Where is the truth?\u201d I asked; for this I longed: None answered right \u2019mid all the answering throng; For ever side by side lay light and shade.\u201c Where is,\u201d I cried, \u201cthe one communion pure? Where is the Church in which, clear-traced and sure, The Spirit\u2019s very likeness is portrayed?\u201d4 So sought I long, and hopeless was my quest; These eyes grew dim and blind and found no rest, Till God\u2019s touch opened them, and I was freed. I found the Spirit\u2019s Church in souls made one In this, that they in troth to Christ had come His Bride, to follow where the cross may lead.5 Thus when I see this small world\u2019s narrow thought, Behold the brother not with brother brought, Yet serving Christas each one deemeth right Ah, then a voice from realms of glory calls, Where the last veil is rent and earthward falls, And where God\u2019s love, eternal, burneth bright.6 No more we put that query without end, To which self-chosen church our feet did trend What doctrines we believed, what sacred rites. In Christ we were in bonds that nought could break; Who, by His cross and death, do all forsake, Such as were far asunder He unites.7 No longer does one heed mere formal phrase, Or seek for others\u2019 creeds through winding maze, For in Himself was truth made manifest. And out of every tongue and every land He formed one Church to meet His own demand His Body, where His fulness is expressed.",

They met the tyrant\u2019s brandished steel, The lion\u2019s gory mane, They bowed their necks, the death to feel: Who follows in their train?4 A noble army, men and boys, The matron and the maid, Around the Savior\u2019s throne rejoice, In robes of light arrayed.

Send messengers o\u2019er land and sea To bring Thy children all to Thee; Thy name can save, Thy name makes free; We consecrate ourselves to Thee As servants true, as warriors brave and true.",

Like Mary I sit at His feet, Like John I recline on His breast; His presence is fulness of joy, His bosom is infinite rest.3 I dwell with the King for His work, I\u2019ve part in His glorious plan To bring in His kingdom to earth And tell His salvation to man. The world has its work and rewards, I count them but folly and loss; My business is only His work, My message is only His cross.4 I dwell with the King for His work, The work, it is His and not mine; He plans and prepares it for me And fills me with power divine. So duty is changed to delight, And prayer into praise as I sing; I dwell with my King for His work And work in the strength of my King.5 We\u2019ll dwell with the King for His work And work thru each day of the year. Perhaps ere it passes, the King In glory Himself shall appear. Oh, then in some closer embrace, Oh, then in some nobler employ We\u2019ll dwell with the King for His work In endless, ineffable joy!",

But this I know, He heals the broken-hearted, And stays our sin, and calms our lurking fear, And lifts the burden from the heavy laden, For yet the Savior, Savior of the world, is here.3 I cannot tell how He will win the nations, How He will claim His earthly heritage, How satisfy the needs and aspirations Of east and west, of sinner and of sage. But this I know, all flesh shall see His glory, And He shall reap the harvest He has sown, And some glad day His sun shall shine in splendor When He the Savior, Savior of the world, is known.4 I cannot tell how all the lands shall worship, When, at His bidding, every storm is stilled, Or who can say how great the jubilation When all the hearts of men with love are filled.

Should she not wear the signs of grief Until her Lord return?5 The whole creation groans, And waits to hear that voice That shall her beauteousness restore, And make her wastes rejoice.

Sweet is the promise as weary years fly: O I shall see Him descend from the sky, Coming for me, for me! Coming for me, for me, Coming for me, for me; O I shall see Him descend from the sky, Coming for me, for me!",

There\u2019s power in the blood, power in the blood; Would you live daily His praises to sing? There\u2019s wonderful power in the blood.",

Because I am a rebel Thy pardon I receive: Because Thou dost command me, I can, I do believe.6 O infinite Redeemer, I bring no other plea; Because Thou dost invite me I cast myself on Thee.

We worship Thee that Thou didst leave Thy throne, To come as our High Priest with sin to deal. Lord Jesus, Thou hast offered Thine own blood, And settled once for all our peace with God.2 Thy blood has now been sprinkled on the throne In full redemption for Thy people\u2019s sin. The sweetness of the love that Thou hast shown Has ris\u2019n to fill the holiest place within. And by the blood once offered in that place God flows to us in mercy and in grace.3 Yet, Lord, Thou camest not just to atone, But Thou didst come and bear our sins away. We, with a conscience purged, approach the throne, For all our sins were laid on Thee that day. Thou, separated from the Father\u2019s face, Didst pay the awful price for us in grace.4 The way into God\u2019s presence thus is cleared, For ransomed sinners who have heard Thy call. Thou, Lord, hast taken all that we had feared When Thou didst shed Thy blood and give Thine all; Our heart in grateful praise to Thee we bind, And now our life in Thee alone we find.",

The living creatures praise Him, Who rest not, day nor night. So let us join their praises To Him who loosed God\u2019s plan; We\u2019ll lift with theirs our voices To praise the Lion- Lamb!",

He\u2019s a Father to the orphans And a refuge tried indeed In His holy habitation What a wonderful salvation! Hallelujah, hallelujah, Hallelujah, Amen!3 Here the lone have found a family, Here the desolate a home; Prisoners are brought from bondage To prosperity unknown.

See the singers go before, Praising, praising o\u2019er and o\u2019er: Hallelujah, hallelujah, Hallelujah, Amen!8 Little Benjamin is leading, Then great Judah\u2019s company: Son of sorrow at God\u2019s right hand, Lion with the scepter see. Zebulun and Naphtali Make the joyful tidings fly: Hallelujah, hallelujah, Hallelujah, Amen!9 Saints, thy strength has been commanded From the temple glorious; Still we pray that God may strengthen All that He has wrought for us.

We sense that Thou, O Lord, art satisfied; And we too share this blissful satisfaction Sweet foretaste of the Bridegroom with His Bride.",

Stacte doth sons produce, Onycha from sin doth loose, Galbanum all death repels, In spirit, Lord. Equal proportion, In resurrection; Seasoned with salt are they. Ground into powder fine, Consumed with fire divine O what an incense this, Jesus my Lord!3 Ointment is Christ for us, Exceeding glorious! Incense is Christ for God, Wholly for Him. Ointment flows down to us, Christ is our portion thus; Incense ascends to God, Fragrant to Him.\u2019 Tis by th\u2019 anointing Christ we experience And then the incense burn.

Could touch His heart\u2019s agony there.2 We\u2019ll soon see the Lord, as He is, face to face, We\u2019ll know Him as never before; But that touch today, healing our broken heart, In that day will be felt no more. That day, though our lips offer unceasing praise, No tears, then, nor prayers fervent burn; Nor is there the comfort received through much pain, Nor trust gained through trials to learn, Nor trust gained through trials to learn.3 Exceeding in glory, that day we\u2019ll be crowned, Yet there\u2019ll be no cross to obey; The sweet fellowship of His suff\u2019rings for us We only can share in today. Once we\u2019ve that rest entered, no weariness then, Nor chance will remain to partake The trials nor the hardships, nor happiness lost, Nor suffering borne for His sake, Nor suffering borne for His sake.4 Oh, chances to suffer for Him are so few, His shame and derision to bear; Such blest opportunities soon pass away, That He in our troubles may share. All loneliness, misunderstandings and scorn Despisings and sorrows will flee; I treasure these blessings, for through them, O Lord, I enter sweet oneness with Thee, I enter sweet oneness with Thee.5 I long to behold, Lord, Thy countenance soon, What rapture with Thee, Lord, to meet. But neither seek I all these trials to avoid; Such times, Lord, are too rare and sweet. Have mercy on me, fill me with Thy great love, For Thee, Lord, to live at all cost; Lest Thy servant, hoping for that blessed day, That day, regret chances were lost, That day, regret chances were lost.",

But the enemy, somehow subtly Tempted man the other tree to know.4 Then came Jesus Christ as the tree of life, Satisfying all that God required. He redeemed the earth, giving man new birth, And became the food that man desired.5 Jesus ne\u2019er designed e\u2019er to feed our mind; All good knowledge only puffeth up. But He came, He said, as a feast instead, Not to analyze, but only sup.6 As we eat the Lord, growth He does afford, Life and numbers soon will be increased. We must clearly see God\u2019s recovery Christ is not religion, but a feast.7 Eating is the way to live Christ today, Of the eating there should be no lack.

Girt about the breasts and serving, He the priesthood fully bears; Cherishing the lampstands dearly, He for all the churches cares.3 Ancient One He is, yet fresher Than the newly driven snow; Eyes are as a flaming fire, Feet as burnished brass aglow. Tender eyes that gazed at Peter, Now are as a burning flame; And the voice that whispered, \u201c Mary,\u201d Many waters now became.4 John, once formerly reclining On His breast, now fell as dead, When he saw Him thus in spirit, As He is, exhibited.

Though the law is good and holy, Flesh, to keep the law, is dead; What we need is not religion, But the Word of life instead.3 Though it\u2019s feast day, he\u2019s not happy, Though the Sabbath, there\u2019s no rest; Lying in his poor condition, Miserable and sore depressed. At that moment Jesus saw him, Knowing he was thus so long.\u201c Will you be made whole?\u201d He asked him,\u201c Healed and walking, well and strong?\u201d4 Though he told his hopeless story, Scarce believing what he\u2019d heard, Yet, soon to his feet arising, He received the living word. This is all our situation, Welike himwere lying there In the sheep-fold of religion, Under law\u2019s prevailing care.5 While we yet were weak and helpless, Christ the Son of God did come.

Dead teachings cannot help the seed; The law of life is what we need.5 The law of life in us, In function now we see, Works not by will and thought But automatically. It saturates, conforms to Him; The standard model spreads within.6 Our sins are all forgiv\u2019n, His life imparted too; God is our God today, And we\u2019re His people true. We know Him in an inward way: These blessings four have come to stay.7 We\u2019re being sonized now; The life within will do The deep transforming work Of making us anew. In ages past, the work was done Now prayer is overpraise the Son!",

When once for all He died; No more are we the sinners poor, We\u2019re fully glorified.2 We\u2019re dwelling in the house of God, The church life glorious. The shrinking-back, low Christian life, Is not the life for us! We\u2019re passing through the Holy Place Of mind, emotion, will; We\u2019re dwelling in the Holiest Where God our being fills.3 We\u2019re under the New Covenant, With glorious items, three: The law of life, spontaneous, Transforming utterly; We are His people, He\u2019s our God Oh, bless\u2019d reality; We all are fully able now To know God inwardly.4 A supplement God added then; This item we must know: Christ Jesus did put sin away Two thousand years ago. No memory of sin at all, It\u2019s hist\u2019ry, done and gone; In spirit now the law of life Will take us swiftly on.5 Two things accomplished by our Lord On Calvary\u2019s cross, we see: The law of life, the end of sin! Our God\u2019s economy. Since all His work was finished there, He entered into rest; Now on the throne He prays that we Will take our full bequest.6 We\u2019ll drop our former concepts, Lord, To take this finished way; Appropriating each bequest, We\u2019ll praise You more each day. We\u2019ll heed our High Priest\u2019s inward call\u201c Come forward!\u201d to the end Until we reach the final goal; The New Jerusalem!",

God had judged, no light did shine; Hollowness and void were mine.3 Satan\u2019s fall had filled the seas With corruption, sin, disease. Yet the Spirit brooded o\u2019er The abyss: chaos no more!4 God then spoke: the air was cleared! Darkness which I once had feared Was dispelled by God\u2019s own light. A new day! No longer night!5 As the light began to shine His discernment became mine. I began to see aright; God divided dark from light.6 Then the waters He did split; An expanse between them fit, Earthly things from heavenly, Separated hence they\u2019d be.7 On the third day God designed That the waters be confined. In our lives dry land must be; No more death and no more sea!8 God commands: death\u2019s water halt! Christ, the good land, we exalt! Separated from all strife We enjoy Christ as our life.9 Growing in us inwardly; Grass, then herb, then fruitful tree. We begin as but a blade; Soon our being He\u2019ll pervade.10 Then the fourth day lights He set; Bearers these, more definite. Richer light to radiate, Higher life to generate.11 Sun, the greater light we see Ruling day triumphantly; Yet when darkness fills the skies, Waxing moon is on the rise!12\u2019 Tis the Church she typifies; For her light on Christ relies. In His image meant to be, She reflects Christ perfectly.13 Lastly, precious stars He placed, Strong in spirit, full of grace; Shining when the moon seems faint, These are overcoming saints.14 What a glorious picture here: Sun and moon and stars appear! Lord, our prayer is that we\u2019d be Full of light and life in Thee.",

So man, created to fulfill God\u2019s plan, Became a failure full of Satan\u2019s dearth.4 Then God came in the Person of the Son; Lived He on earth, Christ Jesus was His name A living model so that everyone Could live by life, God\u2019s fullness to obtain.5 This God-man, Christ, went to the cross and died, By death He ended knowledge, the old man. Things negative forever crucified, Death He subdued, a new life He began!6 From death He resurrected and became The living Spirit to give life to us. When we believe and call upon His name; This living Spirit comes to dwell in us.7 By this the very Triune God is now The living Spirit mingling deep within. Our spirit joins in oneness; this is how We are one spirit evermore with Him.8\u2019 Tis by this Spirit that we walk and act, We have our being, think, and see all things; We\u2019re now within this Spirit! What a fact! This Spirit to us all God\u2019s fullness brings!9 So now we have to set our mind on Him; Each day, each hour, our mind on Him must be; That by this Spirit we\u2019d be saved within By life and reign in life eternally.10\u2019 Tis by this Spirit that we shall be freed From Sin whose law inside us death would bring. Our mortal bodies will have life indeed; Thus sanctified we\u2019ll be in everything.11 This Spirit shall transform our natural life, Save us from self, build us in one new man, Till we\u2019re conformed to be like Jesus Christ, Thus finishing our God\u2019s eternal plan.12 Life is our God and life is Christ our Lord.

And at the end the same, The river doth remain, God in the Lamb doth flow, The tree prevails to grow, And God flows on forever.3 God flowed Himself into a man, The man we call Christ Jesus. He gave up His own life for man And God\u2019s own life releases. Though Satan did his best To put God\u2019s flow to rest He had Him crucified And cruelly pierced His side But out came blood and water!4 The blood and water flowed from Him, In streams of pure salvation. The blood brings cleansing from all sin; Water, regeneration. And now the Spirit flows, Brings God where\u2019er He goes. All he could do, the foe, Was just release the flow.

O Lord, work Thyself within us Till th\u2019 electrum in us shines.4 By our passing through this cycle, Living creatures we become To express the life of Jesus; He with whom we\u2019ve been made one. We express Him as a human, As a man so good and fine; Balanced, normal, never striving; Fully human, yet divine.5 We express Him as a lion Conquering every enemy; As an ox obedient, lowly, Faithful in His ministry. We express Him as an eagle, So transcendent, soaring high; Never held by fear or flatter, He above it all does fly.6 Hallelujah! What a figure Of the way God deals with us!

Righteous was His condemnation, Righteous His requirement; For the law had deemed us sinners, And for judgment we were meant.2 Oh, how blest the love that spared us, For the law had judged us dead. God, to meet the righteous judgment, Passed it on His Son instead. Hallelujah! Our Redeemer, Christ, to God has purchased us; Now enjoying His redemption, We become God\u2019s righteousness.3 God is holy in His nature, Holiness is what He is. In this way He sanctified us, Makes our nature one with His. Spreading from our quickened spirit, He renews each inward part, Moving into all our being, Making home in all our heart.4 Oh, how blessed is this process! It\u2019s the Lord\u2019s life-saving way. It\u2019s our constant, real experience; It\u2019s our life from day to day. As we\u2019re minding just the spirit, Then the mind is life to us, And the Lord in us is gaining Transformation marvelous!5 Glory is God\u2019s true expression, All He is, in full, expressed; Final stage of our redemption, Bodily made manifest. Glory is the consummation Of this life which sanctifies; Our complete transfiguration Is the goal which life supplies.6\u2019 Tis for this we wait, expecting To be raptured, glorified. Then the earth will see God\u2019s fullness; Christ completely testified. We fore\u2019er will just express Him, Nature will rejoice to see All the sons of God in glory Manifested finally.7 By His mercy, we\u2019re selected, Ours a glorious destiny. Not by running, nor by willing, But through God\u2019s own sovereignty. Once we were wild olive branches, Now the root and fat partake, Grafted in, rejoice together, Growing for the kingdom\u2019s sake.8 As we\u2019re daily in this process And by life are sanctified, How we thank Him for the blessing Of the church life He\u2019s supplied. Here God is our full enjoyment, Practical and real to us; Sons we are, and heirs together, In the church life, glorious!",

In those hours, when prayer cannot be uttered, Only groaning from my breast is heard. Then the Spirit, in like manner, helps me, Praying in my weakness unto God.2 Lord, my prayer is not for deeper suffering, But that from each trial I\u2019d be free. Let the cup of bitterness be taken; Yet, Thy will, not mine, dear Lord, must be. Even now, though trials sore surround me, Still within my heart there is a peace, For the love of God outpoured within me Floods my heart and bids my doubting cease.3 Blest assurance! God has fully ordered Every matter by His sovereign hand; Every person (though we see so dimly), Every thing\u2019s according to His plan. Every trial is but the Father\u2019s answer To the groaning of the Spirit\u2019s prayer; May He gain in every tribulation, Until we Christ\u2019s glory fully share.4 How could God from all His dealings spare us, After He spared not His only Son? Could the Potter\u2019s hand upon the vessel Ever leave the shaping work undone? For the center of God\u2019s heart\u2019s desire Is that many brethren we will be Unto Christ, His precious First-begotten, And to Him, conformed we\u2019ll fully be.5 Heirs of God! Joint-heirs with our Lord Jesus! What a hope of glory this for us! Though the suff\u2019rings presently seem grievous, Greater far the glory then for us! Yea, in all these things we more than conquer, Through the One whose love has us possessed; Soon the day for which waits all creation, When the sons of God are manifest!",

Diligence, diligence, let us now apply; For if we, to these three, full attention show From the seed of faith the fruit of love will grow.7 In the growth from the seed many items come; By this growth in the Lord fruitful we become. For this we need to see what the Lord\u2019s begun, Ne\u2019er forgetful be nor blind to what He\u2019s done.8 Diligence day by day will this growth insure; Diligence thus will make our election sure. When indeed with this seed we cooperate, We\u2019re supplied the kingdom\u2019s entrance, rich and great.9 For this growth, for this growth, Lord, ourselves we give, By the faith, promises, and the pow\u2019r to live.

Oh, the salvation out of Zion comes; He brought us back from our captivity. Now we rejoice and are exceeding glad; Now we rejoice and are exceeding glad!2 In the Holy City with His own He dwells; O Lord, our Lord, how excellent Thy name! He\u2019s enthroned upon the praises of His saints; All His delight in Zion does remain. The local churches are His move today He is our portion, we are satisfied. Oh, what a goodly heritage have we; Oh, what a goodly heritage have we!3 Who shall in His holy tabernacle dwell, Who shall ascend to His most holy hill? Those who seek for Him and purify their heart; This generation now that seeks His face. Oh, seek His face, ye children of the earth, Open your heart, and let the King come in. He will come in, and He shall live and reign; He will come in, and He shall live and reign!4 Look! God\u2019s tabernacle now is with the saints; Emmanuel God with us, we proclaim. Everything is done, so let His children come; Christ and the churchwhere God and man are one! Lift up your heads, ye cities of the earth; Open your gates, and let the King come in. Shout to His praise He\u2019s coming in to reign! Shout to His praise He\u2019s coming in to reign!",

Though sin should e\u2019en beguile man, Then mock his helpless state, He never could forsake her, His yearning ne\u2019er abate.4 Then mercy richly flourished, And love was, oh, so vast, As graciously He sought her With wisdom unsurpassed. The love He gave to win her God only comprehends! His life laid down, an offering Whose fragrance yet ascends.5 And now in resurrection To her He draws most near, And with untold affection In glory does appear.

Oh, deeper yet we pray, Do work in us each day; Go deeper, through and through, Till in Thee we\u2019re wholly new.2 Higher, higher, in the life of Jesus; Lord, we are so low. By Thy life we all can go much higher Higher let us go. Oh, higher yet we pray Transform us every day And richer in the flow; May Thy life be all we know.3 Growing, growing, in us He is growing, More and more each day. Into all our living He is flowing This is now His way. For growth, O Lord, we pray; Increase in us each day. It\u2019s not enough to know; Now Thy life in us must grow.4 Living, living, Christ is all our living, He\u2019s so practical: Small things, big things, anything and all things He\u2019s involved in all. Live Christ in every way; Oh, live Him out today. His name you now must call, And give Him your all for all.5 Person, Person, Jesus is our Person, Living now in us. He\u2019s our tastes, our attitudes and actions; Oh, how glorious! Our Person, Lord, Thou art Make home in all our heart. As life in every way Be our Person, Lord, each day.6 Churches, churches, in the local churches We all find the flow: Deeper, higher, Christ as all our living, For the church we grow. The churches are today Just Christ in every way. For this, from self we cease, For Thy Body, Thine increase.7 Building, building, we will see the building Of the church this way: Christ experienced will produce the building He\u2019s the only way. Oh, build us, Lord, we pray, By growth of life each day. Oh, make us now such men For the new Jerusalem.8 Coming, coming, Jesus soon is coming For His chosen Bride. In the churches we are all preparing To be glorified. Lord Jesus, come again This cry is deep within We\u2019ll praise Thee to the end, Oh, come back! Come back! Amen!",

( O, can this be?) E\u2019en midst the fearsome night . . . She now affords her Lord such rest, The foe is put to flight!8 A vessel to contain the King!( This type is full of worth.) A palanquin He\u2019s made Himself For His move on the earth!9 Of wood this vessel is composed: Christ\u2019s ris\u2019n humanity. Its silver pillars for support And floor of gold we see!10 The seat of purple signifies Christ is of kings the King. To Him, as fittings for within, Their love His dear ones bring!11 The day will come(\u2019tis surely soon) And glad will be Thy heart What boast and glory to Thyself; Thy crown, Thy counterpart!12 A garden fair, enclosed is she With spices, fragrant, sweet. She now brings forth materials The building to complete!13 A city pleasant, comely, too; No greater building, this! So beautiful, yet to the foe A conq\u2019ring army \u2019tis!14 As we eat Jesus, praise the Lord, The transformation\u2019s done, Until at last, the work\u2019s complete Christ and His Bride are one!",

We\u2019ll come and build!3 O Lord, against these days, Inspire some for Your building, Just as in David\u2019s day A remnant who are willing To come and work in Your house, Oh, what a blessed charge! Your heart\u2019s desire, is our desire We come, O Lord, to build.4 Within those whom You\u2019d call Put such a restless caring For building to give all These times are for preparing; The gates of hell cannot prevail Against the builded Church!

If you should seek the will of God, Don\u2019t waste another minute; The church life is His glorious will, And you too must get in it.2\u201c What is the will of God for me?\u201d How oft you\u2019ve asked this question. It is the church life, corporately, Where God finds His expression. Don\u2019t watch the church life from afar, Or erringly construe it; Come gaze upon it from within You\u2019ll give your whole life to it.3 The church life here is realized,\u2019 Tis all the Lord intended; And in this rich experience All further seeking\u2019s ended. The church life is His glorious will Now for yourself begin it. The surest way to know His will Is simply to get in it.4 So let us give our all for this, And hold ourselves not dearly; The church life is the will of God, Let\u2019s take our standing clearly. Oh, we have found the will of God; Christ died and rose to win it. The church life is His glorious will, And, praise the Lord, we\u2019re in it!",

Arise, O Lord, into Thy rest, Thou and Thy ark so strong. Thy priests are clothed with righteousness; Thy saints with joy and song.3 The Lord has sworn in truth to us, He will not turn away His Seed shall sit with Him enthroned, And reign with Him for aye. The Lord hath found a place to dwell, Hath chosen Zion fair; His habitation it will be, It is His rest fore\u2019er.4 Her food abundant He will bless, Her needy, satisfy; And with salvation clothe her priests, And all her want supply. The horn of David\u2019s budding here, A lamp for earth\u2019s dark night.

But Noah heard the voice of God and did His word obey; His business was to build the ark; he couldn\u2019t waste a day.2 The generation at that time was evil and perverse; The wickedness upon the earth was waxing worse and worse. But Noah stood against the age and ne\u2019er the vision lost. The ark of testimony must be built at any cost.3 There were at that time many men who said they worshipped God; They served Him and they sacrificed and yet \u2019twas very odd, The very thing that God desired they mocked and ridiculed. Their heart was set upon this age and by the devil ruled.4 One day the ark was finished and eight souls were led aboard. God shut the door and then the heavens opened and outpoured. It rained, but Noah took no thought for he was safe inside. When all the earth was flooded, he above it all did ride.5 The ark was just God\u2019s testimony on the earth that time. For God had found a corporate man through whom His light could shine. He needed something built through which He\u2019d fully be expressed, And now it is the local church where God is manifest.6 Be careful lest this age would lead you from God\u2019s heart\u2019s desire. For Jesus\u2019 testimony must set all our hearts afire. The local churches are the ark, God\u2019s testimony true. For this we leave the age behind and give our hearts anew.",

Oh, let us hearken to His call If we miss this, we\u2019ve missed it all!5 Then unto Smyrna, suffering, sore\u201c You have been tried, but something more Be faithful unto death,\u201d we\u2019re told( Not just of body but of soul).6 Be faithful \u2019til what\u2019s natural dies; Your circumstances don\u2019t despise; The Lord has sent them all to you To prove that your first love is true.7 From Pergamos we clearly see The world has wed Christianity! And faithful Antipas did fall He dared to stand against it all.8 To wed the world we all must fear: His spoken word will save us here If to His speaking we give heed, We\u2019ll separated be indeed.9 Then Thyatira comes at length: Her mixture with the world her strength. Fine flour leavened by the yeast, A harlot riding on a beast.10 Lord, we are mixed but hardly know; To us this mixture fully show. Each added thing we will refute Until we\u2019re wholly absolute.11 And then from Sardis, we can know Life is the way that we must go! She says she\u2019s living, but she\u2019s dead; She needs to touch the Lord instead.12 Lord, take us all the way to life To overcome the deadness rife. Away from deadness we would flee That full of life we\u2019ll always be.13 Now Philadelphia comes at last; That which she has she should hold fast The brothers\u2019 love, the name, the word; This church has satisfied the Lord.14 We as the brothers all are one; We\u2019re one by life, and life alone. If we His word and name do keep A glorious building God will reap.15 Laodicea warns us all: From Philadelphia some will fall. By saying, \u201c I am rich,\u201d it\u2019s then The Lord is outside wanting in.16 Lukewarmness we must ever spurn And in the spirit always burn, The inward life experience gain, And pay the price with Him to reign.17 Lord, shine Your light on us today That we may fully go Your way; Anoint our eyes and let us see So You can have recovery.",

Troublers too shall know He loves thee; They to thee must then bow down.\u201c Hold thou fast, for I come quickly, That no man may take thy crown.\u201d4 Hallelujah, overcomers,\u201c In the temple of My God, I will build them in as pillars, Nevermore to go abroad.\u201d God\u2019s own name is written on them And the new name of the Lord. With the triune God they\u2019re blended; They\u2019re the city of our God.5 Hallelujah, out of heaven, Comes the New Jerusalem: Gates of pearl and walls of jasper, Mingled with each precious gem. Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Has become His Bride so dear. Now the Spirit in the churches Speaks to all who have an ear.",

At first the mighty rebel one The earth from God obtained; Then from the Lord the air had won, Establishing his reign.2 So God\u2019s intention was to gain His kingdom on the earth, The place where He could fully reign And show to all His worth. Thus He began in Genesis To forward His great plan. Out of this darkened, lost abyss Our God created man.3 But Satan caused the man to fall From God\u2019s eternal grace. Then Abraham received the call To head the chosen race. The Jews were led from Pharaoh\u2019s hand Through sea and wilderness Into the promised Canaan land, God\u2019s kingdom to express.4 The Israelites refused God\u2019s reign, Desired an earthly king; The kingdom then was lost again Till David was to bring God\u2019s kingdom back to earth once more For God to rule through him; But Israel failed as once before God\u2019s kingdom to bring in.5 Such was the situation when Our God became a man, Declaring to all men,\u201c Repent! The kingdom is at hand.\u201d A perfect model of God\u2019s rule, The King, full qualified! But Satan as a desperate fool Had Jesus crucified.6 This Jesus went into the grave And death He overcame. Now resurrected He will save The earth from Satan\u2019s reign. He as the Spirit enters man To fill him with His life. These men, the church, fulfill His plan To save the earth from strife.7 Now on the earth the church we see, God\u2019s kingdom here expressed, Where He has full authority His rule to manifest. The place where Satan has to flee Our mighty conquering rod, The kingdom through the church will be Brought to the earth for God.",

The wise have abundance of oil, The foolish are empty instead; The wise used their time to buy oil, The others their chance forfeited.2 Lord Jesus, Thy message is clear: You\u2019re coming for those who are wise, Who buy up their oil today, Who deal with all hindering ties. Those virgins whose souls are transformed, Whose vessels much oil contain, Who love not their lives unto death They in Thy great kingdom shall reign.3 Our lamps to shine forth must be trimmed By calling on Thee every day. In spirit we must exercise To burn all the oldness away. But there is a much deeper need: Reality in us must grow, Until it makes home in our hearts, Till oil in our vessels o\u2019erflows.4 We see how this age is so dark, We know that blest hour is near. Our Lord may return anytime Lord, strike in us this holy fear, That we may each moment redeem By taking Thy Word in by prayer, By learning each lesson You give, And thus for that hour prepare.5 Lord Jesus, how blest to be those Who bring in Thy kingdom to earth, Affording Thee rule over all And showing to all Thy great worth! How blest to be those at the feast, Where Thou wilt be one with Thy Bride! Lord, make us wise virgins for Thee, Who e\u2019er in Thy presence abide.",

By then God\u2019s wrought His finished work: Himself dispensed to us; And all creation \u2019round admires His product, glorious.5 The angels that before our God In brightest splendor stand, Will join the universal praise To Him for all He\u2019s planned.

In creation He began With a simple garden planted This, the setting for His plan.2 Man was made, the first step God took To achieve His final goal, As a vessel, a container, Three partsbody, spirit, soul. God, of dust, a body formed him, Breath of life into him breathed This part is man\u2019s human spirit By which God may be received.3 In the garden God had planted Every tree He made to grow, Good for food, to sight most pleasing, And the tree of life also! Second, then, in God\u2019s intention Was that man should freely eat Of the life-tree in the center To obtain His life complete.4 Third, we see a river flowing, Out of Eden coming forth, With its flow in four directions East and west and south and north As on Christ our life we\u2019re feeding, Living water in us flows. Hallelujah for this river And the watering it bestows!5 In the flowing of the river Gold, pearl, onyx stone we see; Three materials, raw yet precious, For God\u2019s building meant to be. Look, these elements are shining\u2019 How can we, then, shine as they? Simply by the Lord, the Spirit, Us transforming every day.6 God the Father (in this fourth step), Source of life, is gold divine; Christ the Son was wounded by us To produce the pearl so fine. God the Spirit brings the stones forth Transformation of the clay. By the flowing of the Spirit Changed we\u2019ll be from day to day.7 Insufficient are materials Precious though they be and best: These must be built up together That God\u2019s house they may express. Fifth step: We ourselves hand over To the building that we be Built into God\u2019s house, His dwelling. One in each locality.8 Finally, in Revelation, Is the picture of Christ\u2019s Bride Consummation of God\u2019s purpose; He is fully satisfied. New Jerusalem, a city, Is the Bridegroom\u2019s counterpart So the church built up together Forms the Bride for Christ\u2019s own heart.9 How can we, as those who truly Long to see God reach His goal, Be united and related? By denial of our soul! As we contact Christ in spirit, Feed on Him as life to us, Then His life will flow, transform us To His Bride, all glorious!",

Struggle not, no; just believe this, For His word assures it\u2019s true; All you need to do is thank Him For all that He\u2019s done for you.3 Did you know that all the Bible Is a will, a testament? Everything that Christ accomplished Is for all God\u2019s children meant. As His child you are included, For His word stands fast and true; So by faith you now inherit All that He has done for you.4 Did you know God has a family? Yes, He does, in fact, it\u2019s us. That\u2019s why we are here enjoying All He is, so marvelous. He\u2019s our God and we\u2019re His people, Day by day we love Him more; We\u2019re so happy and so thankful, We just praise Him o\u2019er and o\u2019er.5 All we know is that we love Him, We\u2019re so glad for what He\u2019s done; We are brought to Him, and we all Know the joy of being one. We\u2019re so glad that we\u2019re included, What a fellowship have we! So we\u2019d like to welcome you, friend, Into God\u2019s own family.",
